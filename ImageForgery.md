### Problem Statement:
Develop a machine learning model to detect and classify image forgeries (such as copy-move forgery, splicing, and image retouching) while highlighting the manipulated regions. The model should not only distinguish genuine images from tampered ones but also localize the specific areas of alteration, ensuring efficient handling of high-resolution images across various formats and manipulations.

### Key Components:
1. **Forgery Detection**:
   - Classify images as genuine or manipulated.
   - Detect and localize the manipulated regions in an image.
2. **Forgery Types**:
   - **Copy-Move Forgery**: Detect copied and pasted regions within the same image.
   - **Splicing**: Identify regions where two or more images have been combined.
   - **Image Retouching**: Recognize subtle feature alterations or enhancements.
3. **Localization**:
   - Use bounding boxes or segmentation techniques to highlight altered regions within the image.
4. **Batch Processing**:
   - Efficient processing of large datasets in batches for scalable evaluation.
5. **Confidence Score**:
   - Provide a confidence score for each prediction, indicating how certain the model is in detecting forgery and identifying regions.
6. **Image Format Support**:
   - Handle common image formats like JPEG, PNG, and varying image resolutions and compression levels.

### Key Points:
- **Subtle Manipulation Detection**: The model must detect small and subtle changes in high-resolution images, even in complex cases like retouching.
- **Robust Localization**: Precisely highlight manipulated areas, even if spread across different parts of the image.
- **Generalizability**: Handle different image formats, resolutions, and compression without significant loss of performance.
- **Scalability**: Efficiently process large datasets with varying levels of manipulation in a scalable way, supporting batch processing.

### Examples:
1. **Copy-Move Forgery**:
   - A part of the image (e.g., a car) is copied and pasted elsewhere in the same image.
   - Model should detect duplicate regions and localize them with bounding boxes.
2. **Splicing**:
   - Two unrelated images are combined (e.g., placing a person from one image into a different background).
   - The model should identify regions from different sources and highlight these areas.
3. **Image Retouching**:
   - Minor enhancements, such as smoothing skin or changing lighting, without dramatic alterations.
   - The model should recognize and highlight these subtle modifications.

### Model Evaluation Criteria:
1. **Accuracy**:
   - Ability to correctly classify images as genuine or manipulated.
2. **Localization Precision**:
   - Precision in detecting and highlighting the forged regions (measured using metrics like Intersection over Union (IoU)).
3. **Forgery Classification**:
   - Ability to distinguish between types of forgeries (copy-move, splicing, retouching).
4. **Confidence Score**:
   - Provide reliable confidence scores for each classification and localization task.
5. **Processing Efficiency**:
   - Speed and scalability in handling large image datasets, including time per batch and overall processing time.
