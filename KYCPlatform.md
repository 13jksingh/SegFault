# User KYC Verification Platform

## Problem Statement:
Design a comprehensive KYC (Know Your Customer) verification platform that ensures user authenticity through advanced image verification. The platform should capture a live image of the user, verify it against a provided ID document, and check a second image against a database for potential matches.

## Workflow Overview:
1. **Capture Live Image :** The platform should take a live picture of the user to ensure they are present during the verification process.
2. **Upload Documents :** Users will upload two images:
     - An ID document (e.g., passport or driver's license etc) for facial verification.
     - A second image for database comparison (can be random image).
3. **Verification Process :**
     - Compare the live image with the face in the ID document to confirm identity.
     - Check the second image against a large database to find top k similar images with respective similarity scores.

## Key Components:
1. **Liveness Detection:** Ensure the live image is genuine and not a photo of a photo. You can implement checks such as blinking detection and head movement, feel free to express you creativity.
2. **Flexible Image Formats:** Accept various formats for both uploaded images and ensure accurate facial recognition despite variations in lighting, angles, or accessories (e.g., hats or glasses).
3. **Efficient Database Search:** The platform should effectively search through millions of images in the database, employing algorithms for quick and reliable comparisons. Use any image dataset present over the internet to verify your approach.
4. **Scalability:** Ensure the platform can handle high volumes of users without compromising performance.

## Judging Criteria:
1. **Liveness Verification:** How effectively does the platform determine if the user's image is live?
2. **Facial Recognition Accuracy:** Evaluate the comparison model's ability to handle diverse scenarios, such as changes in lighting or accessories.
3. **Performance and Speed:** Assess the overall speed of the platform and the efficiency of the operations involved.
4. **Image Comparison Logic:** Measure how well the image comparison logic performs against the database in terms of speed and accuracy.

## Bonus Challenges: 
1. **AI-Generated Image Detection:** Implement a feature to identify if uploaded images are artificially generated.
2. **User Engagement Features:** Enhance user interaction within the platform to improve the overall experience.
